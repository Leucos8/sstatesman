#A word by the author
SStatesMan started out as a simple but compelling project to help me learn Visual Basic and the .Net Framework. 
I'm not really a programmer: I've only really studied the good old Pascal and Visual Basic 6 programming languages, with a bit of SQL and HTML.
I hope you enjoy my project.
